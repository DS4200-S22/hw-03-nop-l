            The marks are areas in the form of pie charts. This is the thing that is being used to represent data.
            The channels are colour, tilt, and position.<br> 
            This is how the pie charts are altered depending on the data.
            The data type is position because the pie charts are placed on an x-y plane.      
        </div>

        <div><img src="img/bump_chart.png"><br>
            The marks are points and lines. They are the visuals that represent the data.
            The channels are their position and colour.<br>
            The position in the ranking and their colour are where the information is drawn from.
            The data types are link and item. The links are connecting the items together.
