    <h1> HTML+CSS & Marks+Channels</h1>

        <p>
            The marks are areas in the form of pie charts. This is the thing that is being used to represent data.
            The channels are colour, tilt, and position.
            This is how the pie charts are altered depending on the data.
            The data type is position because the pie charts are placed on an x-y plane.
        </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="container">
        <div><img src="img/bump_chart.png"></div>
        <p>
            The marks are points and lines. They are the visuals that represent the data.
            The channels are their position and colour.
            The position in the ranking and their colour are where the information is drawn from.
            The data types are link and item. The links are connecting the items together.
        </p>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div><img src="img/mind_map.png"></div>
        <p>
            The marks are points and lines. They represent hte data within the visual.
            The channels would be colour and position. The colour changes based on the type of item and the position assists
            in showing the relationship between the items in addition to the lines.
            The data types are items and links. The links show the relationship between each item by linking the items together.
        </p>
    </div>
        

        <div><img src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png"></div>
        <p>
            The marks are lines because the height of the columns is a line. These are represented by columns and the separation points within them.
            The channels are colour and height. The colour changes based on the segments of each column, and the height varies based on the data.
            The data types are items and positions. The bar chart shows the height (position) of each item.
            The height (position) of each segment in the bars also shows the position of each sub-item.
            Each bar corresponds to an item category and each segment in each bar also corresponds to a sub-item within each item category.
